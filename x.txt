                        introduction: "Before you start reading here, one thing you must keep in mind is that ONE simple mistake in the Quran would disprove the entire religion. Why? Because Muslims believe the Quran is the actual, uncreated, eternal, timeless speech of Allah, meaning that if there is just ONE mistake or inaccuracy, it would mean that Islam as a religion is false. Christians do not hold this belief. This is also why Muslims keep telling unbelievers to 'point out one mistake in the Quran', and when such a mistake is brought, they go on tangents, claim that the Arabic needs to be interpreted differently, twist the passage, or bring an explanation so far fetched that in all of human history 99% of humans wouldn't have been able to conclude this from the plain text. Muslims already presuppose that the Quran is true, hence, when the Quran contains a clear error, it crushes their worldview and they must apply horrendous mental gymnastics to make sense out of this blunder. So, in principal, it goes like this:",        sources: [

Muhammad's encounter with 'Gabriel' deeply disturbs him, and he thinks he is demon possessed.  He decides to commit suicide, but is stopped when the spirit appears and says he is an apostle.  Later, when these visitations become infrequent, he again goes and tries to commit suicide.  Each time the spirit intervenes. Whenever Muhammad receives revelation, he feels vividly uncomfortable.  Muhammad then also becomes a victim of black magic and he starts imagining that he was doing things he never actually did."

The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to them), 'Facilitate things for the people and do not make things difficult for them (Be kind and lenient (both of you) with the people, and do not be hard on them) and give the people good tidings and do not repulse them. So each of them went to carry on his job. So when any one of them toured his province and happened to come near (the border of the province of) his companion, he would visit him and greet him. Once Mu`adh toured that part of his state which was near (the border of the province of) his companion Abu Musa. Mu`adh came riding his mule till he reached Abu Musa and saw him sitting, and the people had gathered around him. Behold! There was a man tied with his hands behind his neck. Mu`adh said to Abu Musa, 'O `Abdullah bin Qais! What is this?' Abu Musa replied. 'This man has reverted to Heathenism after embracing Islam.' Mu`adh said, 'I will not dismount till he is killed.' Abu Musa replied, 'He has been brought for this purpose, so come down.' Mu`adh said, 'I will not dismount till he is killed.' So Abu Musa ordered that he be killed, and he was killed. Then Mu`adh dismounted and said, 'O `Abdullah (bin Qais)! How do you recite the Qur'an ?' Abu Musa said, 'I recite the Qur'an regularly at intervals and piecemeal. How do you recite it O Mu`adh?' Mu`adh said, 'I sleep in the first part of the night and then get up after having slept for the time devoted for my sleep and then recite as much as Allah has written for me. So I seek Allah's Reward for both my sleep as well as my prayer (at night).",

As discussed in this video, however, the earliest sources all depict al-Zutt as humans, meaning the night in question had nothing to do with the Jinn, and therefore the testimony of Abdullah — a chief and trusted transmitter of hadith — remains valid (the one argument raised against this hadith, that Abdullah was not present during the Night of the Jinn, becomes a moot point).<br>https://www.raymondibrahim.com/05/13/2025/video-who-rode-muhammad-all-night-long-and-why"

When I came to one of his wives, she said to me, 'O `Umar! Does Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) haven't what he could advise his wives with, that you try to advise them?' ' Thereupon Allah revealed:-- 'It may be, if he divorced you (all) his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you Muslims (who submit to Allah)..' (66.5)",

(I went to him) and found `Umar bin Al- Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), '`Umar has come to me and said: 'Casualties were heavy among the Qurra' of the Qur'an (i.e. those who knew the Qur'an by heart) on the day of the Battle of Yamama, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra' on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur'an may be lost. Therefore I suggest, you (Abu Bakr) order that the Qur'an be collected.' I said to `Umar, 'How can you do something which Allah's Apostle did not do?' `Umar said, 'By Allah, that is a good project.' `Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my chest for it and I began to realize the good in the idea which `Umar had realized.' Then Abu Bakr said (to me). 'You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). So you should search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Qur'an and collect it in one book.' By Allah If they had ordered me to shift one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur'an. Then I said to Abu Bakr, 'How will you do something which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not do?' Abu Bakr replied, 'By Allah, it is a good project.' Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my chest for what He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and `Umar. So I started looking for the Qur'an and collecting it from (what was written on) palme stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last Verse of Surat at-Tauba (Repentance) with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The Verse is: 'Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty..(till the end of Surat-Baraa' (at-Tauba) (9.128-129). Then the complete manuscripts (copy) of the Qur'an remained with Abu Bakr till he died, then with `Umar till the end of his life, and then with Hafsa, the daughter of `Umar.",

In social and religious gatherings, he narrated the condemnatory hadith which he knew about Uthman.

No. The Arabic script used for the Uthmanic Qur’an did not include vowel markings or the dots to distinguish between certain letters. There was a degree of ambiguity in the script that allowed words to be formed or read in different ways, thus making different words. This led to many different recitations, and in time this became a problem. To solve this problem the Muslim governor, al-Hajjaj b. Yusuf, canonized seven different recitations, but others were added later. Today there are ten different recitations based on the Uthmanic Qur’an.",

Initially, however, the publication of this edition was a purely Egyptian affair. It was the work of a government appointed committee, led by Muhammad b. ‘Ali al-Husayni al-Haddad, that was meant to establish a uniform text for religious education in Egypt. Minor adjustments were subsequently made to this text in following editions, one published later in 1924 and another in 1936. [...] The Egyptian government was motivated to begin the project that would lead to the Cairo Qur’an edition due to the variations (or “errors,” as an appendix to the Cairo edition describes them) found in the Qur’anic texts that they had been importing for state schools. In response, the government destroyed a large number of such texts by sinking them in the Nile River and issued its own text. The Cairo project thus followed in the spirit of the caliph ‘Uthman, and the governor al-Hajjaj b. Yusuf (d. 95/714), who are reported to have destroyed competing versions and distributed their own text of the Qur’an in the first Islamic century.",

'Fifty years,' was the reply. <strong>'Woe to such a man!' he exclaimed, 'you are fifty years old and would worship a day-old object!'</strong> At this he became ashamed and departed. On another occasion a woman came with a plateful of flour and requested him, 'Take this and offer it to them.' <strong>So he took a stick, broke them, and put the stick in the hand of the largest. When his father returned he demanded, 'What have you done to them?'</strong> 'I cannot conceal it from you,' he rejoined. 'A woman came with a plateful of fine meal and requested me to offer it to them. One claimed, 'I must eat first,' while another claimed, 'I must eat first.' <strong>Thereupon the largest arose, took the stick, and broke them.'</strong> 'Why do you make sport of me,' he cried out; <strong>'have they then any knowledge!' 'Should not your ears listen to what your mouth is saying,'</strong> he retorted. Thereupon he seized him and delivered him to Nimrod. 'Let us worship the fire!' he [Nimrod] proposed. 'Let us rather worship water, which extinguishes the fire,' replied he. 'Then let us worship water!' 'Let us rather worship the clouds which bear the water.' 'Then let us worship the clouds!' 'Let us rather worship the winds which disperse the clouds.' 'Then let us worship the wind!' 'Let us rather worship human beings, who withstand the wind.' <strong>'You are just bandying words,' he exclaimed; 'we will worship nought but the fire. Behold, I will cast you into it, and let your God whom you adore come and save you from it.'</strong> Now Haran was standing there undecided. If Abram is victorious, [thought he], I will say that I am of Abram's belief, while if Nimrod is victorious I will say that I am on Nimrod's side. <strong>When Abram descended into the fiery furnace and was saved,</strong> he [Nimrod] asked him, 'Of whose belief are you?' 'Of Abram's,' he replied. Thereupon he seized and cast him into the fire; his inwards were scorched and he died in his father's presence.",

Joseph therefore made haste, and led her to the palm, and made her come down from her beast. And as the blessed Mary was sitting there, she looked up to the foliage of the palm, and saw it full of fruit, and said to Joseph: I wish it were possible to get some of the fruit of this palm. And Joseph said to her: I wonder that thou sayest this, when thou seest how high the palm tree is; and that thou thinkest of eating of its fruit. I am thinking more of the want of water, because the skins are now empty, and we have none wherewith to refresh ourselves and our cattle. Then the child Jesus, with a joyful countenance, reposing in the bosom of His mother, said to the palm: O tree, bend thy branches, and refresh my mother with thy fruit. And immediately at these words the palm bent its top down to the very feet of the blessed Mary; and they gathered from it fruit, with which they were all refreshed. And after they had gathered all its fruit, it remained bent down, waiting the order to rise from Him who had commanded it to stoop. Then Jesus said to it: Raise thyself, O palm tree, and be strong, and be the companion of my trees, which are in the paradise of my Father; and open from thy roots a vein of water which has been hid in the earth, and let the waters flow, so that we may be satisfied from thee. And it rose up immediately, and at its root there began to come forth a spring of water exceedingly clear and cool and sparkling. And when they saw the spring of water, they rejoiced with great joy, and were satisfied, themselves and all their cattle and their beasts. Wherefore they gave thanks to God.",

This means, at the time of Muhammad, he had the same Bible we have today, and he confirmed it. So Muhammad confirmed the same Bible we have in our possession today. But we know this Bible completely contradicts the Quran on various topics: the divinity of Christ, the crucifixion, the resurrection, God being our father, the creation story, etc. Muslims have been aware of this for a long time and invented the claim that the Bible therefore must be corrupted or changed, because the Quran affirms its inspiration, but contradicts it in the same chapter. So, Muslims started believing in two sets of 'original scripture' that were truly revealed by Allah and then later changed. But does the Quran say anything remotely close to that? No. Here are a few passages Muslims like to quote in support of a corrupted Bible:"

One thing you shouldn't forget is that Muhammad was illiterate. He didn't know how to write or read. Considering most of the Quran was copied from Jews and Christians at the time of Muhammad (for that also view 'Islam the Copycat'), you would naturally expect that he has no clue what is written inside the Bible. Now, there are verses where the Quran explicitly goes against christian teaching (such as the Trinity or Jesus being God), so Muhammad was certainly aware of what Christians believed. My personal theory is this: Muhammad knew the Christians believed in the Trinity and that Jesus is divine (because people told him sometime, he heard it somewhere) but he thought those beliefs are actually nowhere to be found in the Bible (he most likely also heard that from somewhere / someone). That would explain him confirming the Bible but contradicting it at the same time, and it would also explain why he keeps putting an emphasis on the 'People of the Book' corrupting the Torah and the Bible with their tongues."

Another person was given the resemblence of Jesus to die in his place<br>2. They believed they killed Jesus but it wasn't actually Him<br><br>There are some other theories of what Allah means when he says 'it appeared so'.<br>Lets investigate these two theories: <br><br>1. Someone was given the resemblence of Jesus: for some reason, when Jesus was about to be crucified, someone else was given the resemblence of Jesus to be crucified. But why was Jesus condemned to crucifixion in the first place? Historically we know why, because he claimed to be God. But Islam rejects this. According to Islam, Jesus went around saying 'Believe in one God!' and for that, they wanted to kill Him. Why did they want to crucifiy Him in the first place? And why exactly would Allah do this? Why did Allah not simply save Jesus from the crucifixion but instead make it to appear so that he is being crucified? For what reason? Given the fact Muslims believe that Allah is outside of time, he would know this event would ultimately start the rise of christianity. So why did he do it? Allah created christianity, a false religion that would lead billions into hellfire, the biggest contender to Islam, tons of wars and battles fought over this division, tons of deaths, tons of confusion, tons of people going to hell. At the end of the day it was his fault that the people living at Jesus' time believed he was being crucified. So, Allah purposely deceived billions of people into believing something that never actually truly happened. Christians would get punished because Allah played a trick on them. Does that sound fair?<br><br>2. They mistakened Jesus and killed somebody else: this is highly unlikely as the Romans knew how to kill people. A blunder like this by the Romans in the first century is highly unlikely. But let's say it did happen: how does that explain the rise of christianity? Why did christianity start in the first place? Wouldn't the disciples notice that the person being crucified is not Jesus? No answers. Another thing to add here is that the text does not really support this theory, as it says 'it was made to appear so' or '[another] was made to resemble him'. This theory would more so imply that the Romans simply made a mistake, not Allah deceiving the people at the time.<br><br>And another thing to add here is that this does not really explain the rise of christianity. Suppose Jesus never claimed to be God, and another man was crucified in Jesus' place and Jesus Himself was taken up to Allah, that means this man would have simply died on the cross. Why did the christian movement not stop? Unless they physically saw Jesus being taken up to Allah, but that also doesn't explain the fact they worshipped him as God. Why did the church start in the first place? What did Jesus communicate to them that they started worshipping Him as the Son of God? Why do they say Jesus resurrected from the dead if Jesus was taken up to Allah when he was condemned to be crucified and the man resembling Jesus simply died on the cross? Islam has no answers."

All of those persons share the same divine essence and are therefore the same one true God. The first person of the trinity (trinity = tri (three) + unity) is the Father. The Father is the source of the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son (also called the word of God) is eternally begotten by the Father. ('So a human being is God?' No, not exactly. The word of God has always existed with the father, and then it took on flesh, that is, became a human, Jesus Christ.) The Spirit eternally proceeds from the father through the son. So, the Father is the source, the unbegotten person of the Trinity. The Son comes eternally from him, and the Spirit comes eternally from both. If you find this idea complicated, you shouldn't forget that God is the greatest being to ever exist, unlike anything in creation and beyond our understanding. Naturally we would expect God to exist in a special way.<br><br>If you're a muslim, you can phrase it like this: God, his eternal word, and his Spirit.

Prayer: the Quran does tell muslims to pray, but not how to. the number of daily prayers and how many rakahs (units), the timing of these prayers, the sequence of movements (standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting) are not mentioned in the Quran. The Quran also says 'recite' but not what to recite, the hadiths make it clear. the Quran does also not tell you: to pray towards the Kaaba, how to peform ablution before prayer (order of washing, how many times to wash each part, and exceptions), and how to dress during prayer.<br><br>2. Zakat: the Quran tells muslims to give charity, but not how much, on what assets, and to whom.<br><br>3. Hajj rituals: the Quran tells muslims to go to Mecca, but not the details: what clothing they need put on, which actions to avoid, walking around the kaaba 7 times counterclockwise, walking or jogging seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwah near the Kaaba, and all other details about the pilgrimage.<br><br>4. More on ablution (washing)<br><br>5. Fasting<br><br>6. Law, Halal & Haram<br><br>7. Social & Family life: marriage, etc.<br><br>The reality is, most of islamic practice comes from the hadiths. If you reject the hadiths, you're basically no muslim anymore. The Quran also condemns this viewpoint. Another thing to add is that there are numerous verses in the Quran that you simply cannot fully understand without a hadith explaining it.
